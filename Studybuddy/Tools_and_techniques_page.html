<p class="Tools_and_techniques_text">It is a method used for retaining information, where flashcards are organized into a box in 5 separate sections. To use this technique, you will need to answer the questions on the flashcards and when you get the question wrong, you will move that card to a more often visited section and when the question is right, it is moved down to a less-visited section. The end goal is to put all cards to the least visited section where the questions are answered correctly each time indicating the user has successfully retained the information.
